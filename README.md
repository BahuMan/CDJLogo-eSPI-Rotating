# Rotate CoderDojo logo on Fri3d2020 badge

This was an experiment using TFT_eSPI and their sprites to draw the logo (using half-circles) into a sprite
and then continuously rotate that logo.

I get about 15 fps with no delay between the rotation

If I'm feeling fancy, I might skip sprites and use 2 half-size (but full) circles rotating around each other to create a swirling yin-yang effect.
